# BSides Vancouver 2014 Crypto Puzzles

This is a library used to create the crypto puzzles used for BSides Vancouver 2014.

It should be noted that this is being released ahead of the conference but since 
there is no prize associated there is no advantage to seeing it on Github before 
anyone else.

Just be nice and not share your answers once they come out.

A sample file (demo.py) is included to show how to use the library for your own 
enciphering and deciphering. Two substitution ciphers and a key-based cipher are 
built into the library.

Feel free to use this to your hearts content. If you want to add other classic 
ciphers to this or have one of your own to add, please do not hesitate to make a 
pull request.
